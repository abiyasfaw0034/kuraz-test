# Simple To-Do List (Frontend Only)

A basic, client-side To-Do List application built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to manage their tasks in a straightforward and intuitive interface, demonstrating fundamental web development concepts.

## Features

- **View Tasks:** Display a list of all tasks.
- **Add Task:** Easily add new tasks via an input field.
- **Mark as Completed:** Click on a task's title to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually styled with a strikethrough.
- **Delete Task:** Remove tasks from the list with a dedicated delete button. Includes a confirmation prompt for deletion.
- **Filter Tasks:** Filter the list to show all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.
- **Input Validation:**
  - Prevents adding empty tasks.
  - Checks for task title length (e.g., max 100 characters).
  - Prevents adding tasks with duplicate titles (case-insensitive).
- **Hardcoded Data:** Tasks are stored in a JavaScript array (no backend needed).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactive logic and DOM manipulation.
